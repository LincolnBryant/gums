  Core classes for the Grid User Management System. This package contains
  all the interfaces and the key classes of GUMS architecture.
  It also contains the interfaces and the implementation for the persistance
  layer (i.e. database), which probably should be moved. All the implementation
  of the AccountMapper and UserGroup might also be moved to another package,
  leaving the main package with really the bare minimum/core classes.
